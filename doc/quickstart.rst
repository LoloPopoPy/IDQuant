Quickstart
==========

Installation
------------

IDQuant requires Python 3.7 or higher. If you do not have a
Python environment configured on your computer,
we recommend that you follow the instructions from
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_.
Then, open a terminal (e.g. run Anaconda Prompt if you have
Anaconda installed) and type :

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install idquant

You are now ready to start IDQuant!

Steps
-----

Open up the IDQuant.ipynb using jupyter notebooks,
and write in the name of the requested run.


Use the "upload data" button to upload MS data
that has been integrated using **C13Profiler** .


Press the "submit data" button. If no errors
are raised, press the "calculate" button.


Results are generated and stored in a new directory
created where the notebook is situated. In it are a
pdf and log file with the name given to the run by the user.

.. note:: For a more in-depth tutorial on the usage of the
          software, see :ref:`tutorial`.
