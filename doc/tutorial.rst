Using the calibration file
--------------------------

The concentrations used to create the calibration curve for each metabolite are
kept in the **calibration.csv** file.

To add metabolites and concentrations to the file, the structure must be kept.
If more points need to be added, add their number at the top of the table.

.. warning:: The name given in the table must be exactly the same as the name used
in the MS experiment.
