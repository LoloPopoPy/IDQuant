Installation
-------------------------------------

IDQuant requires Python 3.7 or higher. If you do not have a Python environment configured on your computer, 
we recommend that you follow the instructions from `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>`_.
Then, open a terminal (e.g. run Anaconda Prompt if you have Anaconda installed) and type :

.. code-block:: bash
	
	cd <path-to-IDQuant>
	pip install setup.py

You are now ready to start IDQuant.
